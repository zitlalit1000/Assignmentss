When i was opening my emails, i encountered a random email. The email said that if i would click the link, i would win a free Iphone8!
I wanted to click the link, but i was not sure if it was actually going to give me it. The next day i clicked the link! It sent me to a 
random website with a bunch of pop ups and ads. I was so confused, i wanted the free iphone8! A second later, my computer went off, i was 
so scared and tried to log back in. I couldnt log in and when i did all my emails were read, deleted, and some were randomly sent. 
Someone had hacked into my email account and with that they logged into my social medias! Everything was hacked, and it all happened by
just clicking a link in a random emai!
